# Full-Stack Job Board Application
This repository contains a full-stack Job Board application built using Next.js, MongoDB, React.js, and Tailwind CSS.
The project was created as part of a learning journey to enhance my skills in web development and explore new technologies.

This application was built by following the guidence provided in a YouTube tutorial by `Coding With David`(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grxNze3hjAQ&t=2113s). I recommend their content for anyone interested in full-stack development.

Thank you for reviewing this repo. Feedback and suggestions are welcome!


## Getting Started
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
